AWS Bedrock Batch Inference Implementation Guide
This guide outlines how to implement and deploy the batch inference script for processing large volumes of medical device incident texts through Claude models via AWS Bedrock.
Overview
The solution performs automated classification of medical device incidents into IMDRF (International Medical Device Regulators Forum) categories using AWS Bedrock and Claude models. It supports:

Classification of both product and patient issues
Batch processing of large datasets
Parallel processing with configurable concurrency
Handling rate limits and throttling with exponential backoff
Cost estimation and tracking
S3 integration for input/output

Components

Lambda Function: Core processing engine that handles batch jobs
S3 Buckets: Store input data, reference data (IMDRF), and output results
AWS Bedrock: Provides access to Claude models for classification

Deployment Steps
1. Upload Reference Data
Upload your IMDRF reference data to an S3 bucket:
bashaws s3 cp imdrf.csv s3://your-bucket/reference/imdrf.csv
2. Create Lambda Function

Create a new Lambda function using Python 3.10+ runtime
Set appropriate memory (min 1024MB) and timeout (10+ minutes)
Add necessary permissions:

S3 read/write access
Bedrock invoke model permission



Upload the batch_inference_script.py to your Lambda function:
bashzip -r lambda_package.zip batch_inference_script.py
aws lambda update-function-code --function-name bedrock-batch-classifier --zip-file fileb://lambda_package.zip
4. Configure Environment Variables
Set these environment variables in your Lambda function:

DEFAULT_MODEL_ID: Default model to use (e.g., "anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0")
DEFAULT_BATCH_SIZE: Number of texts to process in one batch (recommended: 1-3)
DEFAULT_MAX_WORKERS: Maximum concurrent API calls (recommended: 5)
DEFAULT_RATE_LIMIT: Maximum API calls per second (recommended: 5)

Create a Lambda layer with these dependencies:

pandas
numpy
boto3 (Latest version)

Usage
Input Format
The input CSV file should have at minimum these columns:

id: Unique identifier for each record
mdr_text: The medical device incident text to classify

Triggering Batch Jobs
Invoke the Lambda function with a payload like this:

```json
{
  "input_bucket": "your-data-bucket",
  "input_key": "inputs/mdr_records.csv",
  "output_bucket": "your-output-bucket",
  "output_prefix": "outputs/job-20240409",
  "model_id": "anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0",
  "problem_type": "product",
  "batch_size": 2,
  "max_workers": 5,
  "rate_limit": 5,
  "imdrf_bucket": "your-reference-bucket",
  "imdrf_key": "reference/imdrf.csv"
}
```json

You can trigger this via:
```bash
bashaws lambda invoke --function-name bedrock-batch-classifier \
  --payload file://job-config.json \
  output.json
Output Format
The solution produces:

CSV files for each processed chunk
A summary JSON file with job statistics
```bash

The script includes cost estimation based on token usage. Current pricing (subject to change):

Input tokens: $3.60 per million tokens
Output tokens: $18.00 per million tokens

Monitor batch jobs through:

CloudWatch Logs for Lambda execution details
Job summary files in the output S3 location

Best Practices

Batch Size: Keep batch sizes small (1-3 texts per batch) for optimal performance
Rate Limiting: Respect Bedrock service limits (start with 5 RPS)
Chunking: Process large datasets in chunks to avoid memory issues
Testing: Start with small samples before processing full datasets

Troubleshooting

Throttling errors: Reduce concurrent workers or rate limit
Memory errors: Reduce chunk size
Timeout errors: Increase Lambda timeout setting
Parse errors: Check for invalid text formats in your input data
